# HexapodHDA
v0.2.0
Basic state machines for a simple movement are implemented. Missing Bluetooth communication and a lot of testing with the real robot (16.06.2018)
v0.0.1
Implemented inverse kinematics algorithm and interpolation. Interpolation need to be checked, 
because we got offset and the time intervals could be problematic   

v0.0.0
Implemented rough class structure for further implementations and tests on the Arduino Mega 2560


Rough class structure from 16.06.2018
